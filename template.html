  <div id="Hello">
    <h1>Hi I'm Berenice Aybar</h1>
    <div class="Hello">
      <p>I am a first generation Dominican American who has always been resilient and ambitious.
      Born in Bronx, New York, but raised in Waterbury, Connecticut. Motivated to get out of the dangerous
      city of Waterbury I took a leap and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 2018 to pursue my college degree.</p><br>

      <p> I recently became a new mom to a beautiful one-year-old daughter. Becoming a mother has become one of the greatest
      accomplishments of my life. I’m dedicated and on a mission to make sure my daughter lives life 10 times more than she deserves.
      I’m still on a mission to make an impact in the field of Speech Pathology . I want to become a dedicated speech therapist to young children,
      empowering young ladies and gentlemen to have confidence in their everyday conversations.  I am proud to say even as a new mom I am
      determined and proud to still chase my Master’s degree no matter how much of life's day-to-day challenges come my way.</p><br>

      <p> Outside of chasing my academic goals, A life goal of mine is to  become a 6 figure yearly earner. I also would like to explore numerous
      countries on my bucket list. What helps me keep peace of mind and joy is my family gatherings. The Dominican in me comes out on full display
      even if it comes with a little stress, I still cherish the time I get to cook for my family. To the big speakers thumping and all of us
      dancing dembow, bachata, and some salsa. I get so much delight from seeing my family laughing and with satisfied bellies, it truly is unmatched.</p>
