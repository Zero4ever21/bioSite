      <h2>About Me: The College Years</h2>

      <p>Throughout my college years I have attended 4 schools in 3 different cities with many lessons learned along the way. Through trial and error I am still here and want to
      spread the positivity to always chase after your dreams. Each school really was a new chapter for me and it definitely continues to mold me!</p><br>

      <p>At the first school Wake Tech Community College, I learned what it truly meant to be a college student. Really a student in general, all throughout high school I never put
      effort in studying, class work, and extracurriculars. I really thought college would be the same and I was in for a real awakening. After graduating with my Associates in General
      studies the second school I attended was East Carolina University majoring in Speech and Language. This college taught me real adulthood because I had actual rent to pay, utilities,
      groceries, all while keeping up with school. I then took a break because I had a lot to balance with a full-time job as well. I didn't let it discourage me even after finding out I
      would be having my baby girl. I proceeded to look for online schools and found a university not too far. This school taught me what it takes to be a mother making the necessary
      sacrifices to help our future. Many sleepless to maintain my grades all while caring for my daughter. My fourth and final undergrad school actually taught me what my career will entail and I could not be more excited!</p><br>

      <p>Even though it might sound like a lot, going to these different schools has helped me learn so many things and get ready for my dreams. This amazing journey has allowed me to collect all the tools I need for a fantastic career ahead!</p>
